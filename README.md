E commerce app I have done for a technical assignment. In this project I have used the following.

Login - using a REST API stores and uses the access token.<br /> 
products - get and display list of products using a moc service.<br /> 
profile - get and display the profile details using the access token.<br /> 
city - get the users current city using geocode<br /> 

state management - Bloc<br /> 
Api calls - Dio (Interceptor for error handling and getting refresh token)
